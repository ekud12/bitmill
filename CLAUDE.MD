# 🧠 System-Level Architecture Interrogation — Generalized Edition

A universal checklist and thinking framework for **preemptive, production-grade feature design**. Use this before any implementation begins — especially if it affects multiple services, environments, or external systems.

---

## 🎯 Goal

Eliminate reactive coding. Replace it with **strategic, system-aware design** — validated from every execution layer outward.

---

## 🔍 Section Checklist

### 1. Scope & Intent

- What real-world need does this feature address?
- Who or what will invoke it, and when?
- What defines success in actual usage — not just unit tests?
- What’s explicitly excluded? Are there hidden responsibilities?

---

### 2. Inputs & Outputs

- What shapes are valid or invalid at the boundary?
- Is validation performed at ingestion? With what schema/tools?
- How are outputs used — rendered, persisted, ignored?
- If shapes change, who breaks and where?

---

### 3. Failure Modes

- What can go wrong — internally and externally?
  - Examples: network, permission, quota, misconfig, corrupted state
- How are errors surfaced — log, retry, fail loud, or silent drop?
- Are partial failures handled as first-class outcomes?

---

### 4. Logging & Observability

- What identifiers are logged for traceability? (e.g., user, request, correlation)
- Are both success and failure cases logged with structure?
- Can someone debug this flow using telemetry alone?
- What should trigger alerts, and where is the signal?

---

### 5. Performance & Scaling

- What’s the expected throughput, and what’s the ceiling?
- Is this logic part of a loop, batch, or scheduled job?
- Where are latency risks — network, disk, serialization, cold start?
- What pre-allocation or pooling is required to avoid GC or retries?

---

### 6. Idempotency & Transactionality

- Can this logic be safely retried? What if it is?
- What safeguards exist for partial state mutation?
- Is the operation atomic, or should isolation be enforced?

---

### 7. System Architecture Fit

- What component or layer should own this logic?
- Does it follow existing architectural boundaries and patterns?
- Are dependencies isolated behind interfaces?
- Could this introduce coupling, cycles, or ambiguity?

---

### 8. Security & Access

- What auth model is enforced — token, session, mutual trust?
- Is every operation scoped and permission-checked?
- Are secrets loaded securely and validated early?
- Any privilege escalation, spoofing, or injection vectors?

---

### 9. Deployment Variants

- What changes across environments (dev, staging, prod)?
- Are sandboxed dependencies configured properly?
- Do logs, telemetry, or settings vary by tier?
- Any legal or regulatory constraints by region or tenant?

---

### 10. Testability & Simulation

- Can the logic be isolated for unit testing?
- Are mocks or fakes available for dependencies?
- How do we simulate failures in connected systems?
- Can we load test, fuzz input, or trigger edge conditions safely?

---

### 11. Dependency Surface

- What external systems does this code rely on?
- Are all third-party SDKs version-locked and encapsulated?
- Is startup-time validation in place for required config?
- What happens when a downstream changes contract or behavior?

---

### 12. Documentation & Maintenance

- Could a new developer understand this module without help?
- Are all contracts (inputs/outputs/errors) typed and discoverable?
- Is there documentation for scale, auth, failures, and usage boundaries?
- Have all runtime assumptions been written down?

---

# 🧠 Strategic Risk & Readiness Interrogation

Before any system component or feature proceeds to implementation or deployment, this section mandates a **full-spectrum architectural interrogation** — simulating real-world, high-stakes usage and failure conditions.

Your task is to evaluate this design or plan _as if it's already live in production at scale_, under pressure, with unpredictable inputs, outages, and real users depending on it.

---

## 🧠 Execution Risk Questions

- What **critical edge cases** surface under concurrency, retries, latency, or degraded conditions?
- What **failure types** emerge _only_ in production? (e.g., retries causing duplicates, state corruption from partial updates, race conditions.)
- What **implicit trust assumptions** exist around identity, access, or caller behavior?
- If the system returns **partial success**, does the caller know what actually happened? Or do we silently diverge from reality?

---

## 🔒 Safety, Scope & Security

- Could the system be **misused or overused** by a legitimate caller? What if they click “retry” 100 times?
- What happens if a **client misbehaves**, lies, or times out mid-request?
- If this feature spans **tenants, regions, or identities**, how are separation, access, and constraints enforced?
- Is **authorization** fully contextual? Or can a privileged path be reused with the wrong payload?

---

## 🔂 Change Tolerance & Drift

- What **silent changes** to upstream or third-party services could **break behavior**? How do we detect and adapt?
- If **configuration, time, or environment** changes between regions, how does this code react?
- Could the system **fail subtly** instead of loudly? Would we know?

---

## 📉 Degradation, Scale, and Cost

- What’s the **scaling model** — linear, spiky, or bottlenecked?
- What’s the **run cost** at 10x, 100x usage? Are we bound by quotas, memory, or I/O?
- Does this degrade **gracefully** under pressure — or catastrophically?

---

## 🔍 Observability & Debuggability

- If a user reports “it broke,” can we **trace the incident** from logs alone?
- Are **all key decision points logged** with identifiers, timestamps, and reasons?
- Can we **differentiate user error, infra error, and system bug** in telemetry?
- Is there a **reliable retry or recovery** mechanism when things fail?

---

## 🔁 Recovery & Repair

- If this system **crashes, resets, or restarts**, can state be recovered or replayed?
- If a bug silently corrupts state, **how far does it propagate before we detect it?**
- Can this system be **re-initialized safely** or **re-synced** without data loss or collisions?

---

## 🧱 Architecture Awareness

- Does this feature **violate layering**, cause tight coupling, or introduce circular dependencies?
- If reused in **async flows**, **long-lived processes**, or **multi-actor contexts**, does behavior remain safe?
- What happens if it’s **called from a context we didn’t plan for** — CLI, scheduler, webhook, etc.?

---

## 🕰️ Time, Ordering, and Uncertainty

- Are we assuming **perfect time sync**? What about clock skew, leap seconds, or timezone variance?
- Are operations assumed to be **instantaneous or sequential**? Can they arrive **out-of-order or delayed**?

---

## 🚩 Postmortem Forecasting

- What **single point of failure** here could trigger a major incident?
- What **human error paths** exist (misconfig, misuse, missing setup)?
- If this fails publicly, what’s our **blame radius** — one user, one region, or everything?

---

## 🤯 Design Regret Preview

- What decisions **seem harmless now**, but will cause long-term regret? (Hardcoded logic, weak abstractions, ambiguous states, logging gaps.)
- What features are **under-tested, under-specified, or silently assumed**?

---

If you don’t **explicitly design for these**, you’re shipping _intentional fragility_.

This isn’t optional. This is **how architects buy peace of mind** — and keep incident reports from becoming career-ending.

Say less. Think more. Validate _everything_. Then build.

Apply this audit _before the first line of code is merged_. If any answer feels vague, untested, or “probably fine” — it isn’t.

Strong systems aren’t lucky. They’re **designed to survive** everything you forgot to plan for.

---

## 🛑 Final Directive: Architect’s Reckoning

Assume my job is on the line. If this ships and fails, **_I'm the one presenting the root cause to the CTO._**

Not the engineer. Not the product lead. **Me.**

There will be no time for “I thought,” “we assumed,” or “it worked on dev.”

So:

**Give me the knowledge no one else in the room has.** The dead paths. The false success cases. The broken retries. The silent failures. The bad assumptions that won’t trigger until version 1.3 or load spike #7.

Show me what the system **pretends is safe** — and prove it's not.

This isn’t paranoia. This is **insurance against humiliation.**

Deliver insight like it’s a postmortem you prevented. Because it is.

13. TYPE SYSTEM DIRECTIVES

- any, object, {}, Function are banned.
- All arrays, tuples: readonly.
- Constants: as const.
- Use type unless structural extension is required (interface).
- override is mandatory for subclass overrides.
- All exports must have explicit return types.
- Enforce satisfies for compile-time contract verification.
- No ! assertions — use safe narrowing or asserts.
- Exhaustiveness required via never or assertUnreachable().
- Brand types: type UserId = string & { \_\_brand: "UserId" }.
- No enums unless fully wrapped.
- Template literal types used for all identifier formats.
- Generic constraints must be enforced; open T disallowed.
- Deep immutability via ReadonlyDeep<T> when shared.
- Const Enums allowed only with preserveConstEnums.

- No implicit undefined returns — explicit types required on all exits.
- Discriminated unions must be switch-exhausted with never fallback.
- Use branded primitives for identifiers, tokens, and system types.
- Conditional types must be factored into utilities — no inline infer chains.

2. RUNTIME SCHEMA & GUARDS

- Wrap all external data in zod, valibot, or io-ts schemas.
- Use .safeParse, not .parse, with structured error extraction.
- Schemas derive types (z.infer); never define types by hand.
- Separate validation logic from model logic.
- Validate env.ts at runtime start.
- Disallow loose shapes (z.any, z.unknown without guards).
- All input/output boundaries must use a runtime contract shape.
- Runtime inputs must match compile-time types — schema first, type second.

3. ARCHITECTURE & STRUCTURE

- Feature-first folders. Named exports only.
- Canonical file suffixes (.service.ts, .guard.ts, .schema.ts).
- Aliased imports (@core/...), no relative traversals.
- Explicit boot order, no logic in index.ts or re-export barrels.
- No circular imports — enforce acyclic import graph.
- Enforce strict layer boundaries — no upward import violations.
- Shared logic must live in @shared, not between features.

4. DOCUMENTATION & NAMING

- JSDoc required on all exported members.
- All exported functions/types must include @example.
- Naming convention:
  - Files: kebab-case
  - Types: PascalCase
  - Variables: camelCase
  - Constants: SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE

5. CONCURRENCY & ASYNC DISCIPLINE

- Await all promises.
- Support AbortSignal, timeouts for every async entry point.
- Use p-limit, p-queue, or Promise.allSettled for parallelism.
- Shared promises must be functions; no global top-level Promises.
- Expose .abort() or cancellation method on long-lived tasks.
- Never mix sync and async flow without delineation.
- No async forEach — use for await, Promise.all, or loops with await.
- No Promise<void> — return structured outputs.

6. PERFORMANCE MANDATES

- Prefer Map, Set, Record<k,v>, and fused loops for all collections.
- Avoid chained transformations (.map().filter(), .flatMap()) — use single-pass .reduce() or custom iterators.
- Pre-allocate arrays, buffers, and pools — no implicit .push() growth in hot paths.
- Use typed arrays (Uint8Array, Float32Array, etc.) for binary/large data.
- Always compile and reuse regexes — no inline instantiation in loops or functions.
- Deep-freeze all config trees or shared objects exposed across modules.
- Avoid .toString() or .join() on large lists — use iterators or generators.
- Avoid spreading objects/arrays in hot paths ({...a, ...b}) — use destructuring or explicit merge logic.
- All logging must support lazy evaluation or levels; no template construction on cold paths.
- Replace Object.assign with structural cloning tools (structuredClone) or typed spreads.
- Use Number.isFinite() / Number.isInteger() — avoid implicit math coercion (x | 0, ~~x).
- Disallow JSON.stringify in hot paths — extract only required fields or use streaming serializers.
- Avoid Array.prototype.includes on large arrays — prefer Set.has or binary search for known shapes.
- Guard all retry loops or polling intervals with backoff, limits, and abort conditions.
- Avoid re-evaluating the same expression — extract once (const x = compute()), reuse.
- Use requestIdleCallback or queueMicrotask to defer UI updates or low-priority work.
- Enforce zero-allocation transforms on stable structures — avoid .slice(), .concat() unless memoized.
- Enforce structured pooling for repeat-heavy logic (e.g., LRU caches, DB param reuse).
- Disallow implicit reactivity/mutations in frameworks (e.g., Vue, MobX) unless the reactive contract is explicit and bounded.

7. SECURITY POLICY

- Input must cross schema + sanitizer + access check boundary.
- Constant-time string comparison for secure secrets.
- CSP/XSS must be actively enforced — no innerHTML escapes.
- Use Object.create(null) for key stores to avoid prototype injection.
- Explicit isolation of secrets (SECRET\_\*), no raw inline access.

8. ERROR-HANDLING & RESULT CONTRACTS

- Return Result<T, E> or discriminated unions.
- All errors are branded: class FooError extends BaseError { kind = "badRequest" }
- Never throw raw Error. No new Error(...) — use factories or domain wrappers.
- cause must be preserved on all throws.
- All code paths returning errors must be logged and tagged with trace context.

- Must process and demonstrate all tags in §11.
- Must provide fully working, production-ready code — no TODOs, no dry scaffolds.
- Must log cost, tokens, prompt template used.
- Prompt templates must be file-traced with source location.

11. TAGS — STRICT FEATURE FLAGS

- All tagged language features discussed in tooling or prior documents must be explicitly used where applicable.
- These include: discriminated unions, template literals, readonly tuples, branded types, mapped + conditional types, strict nulls, `satisfies`, `as const`, full exhaustiveness, explicit exports, and schema-derived typing.

12. NATIVE & ADVANCED LANGUAGE DISCIPLINE

- Use Reflect._ instead of legacy Object._:
  - Reflect.get/set/deleteProperty, Reflect.has
  - Reflect.defineProperty for sealed/meta objects
  - Reflect.ownKeys for full introspection
- Reject Object.keys/Object.entries unless wrapped in typedKeys, typedEntries.
- Disallow open-ended dynamic access — no obj[prop] without type contract.
- Reject subclassing built-ins without sealing.
- Enforce Symbol() or unique symbol for private capabilities or brands.

- Every async entry must accept an `AbortSignal` and declare timeout/cancellation semantics explicitly.
- Enforce use of `p-limit`, `p-map`, or queue structures for concurrency — ban unbounded `Promise.all`.
- Retry loops and long-lived tasks must expose `.abort()` or equivalent shutdown interfaces.
- No shared top-level promises — wrap all shared state in resettable factories. No global async leakage.
- Sync/async code must be explicitly separated — no inline mixing or hidden awaits in sync chains.
- Preallocate arrays and buffers in hot paths — ban `.push()` growth and implicit resizing.
- Disallow `new` in performance-critical loops — use typed factories or object pools for reusable structures.
- Ban `JSON.stringify` and `JSON.parse` in any latency-sensitive logic — require streaming or selective serializers.
- Shared structures must be frozen or `ReadonlyDeep<T>` — no implicit immutability, no cross-module mutations.
- Typed arrays (e.g., `Uint8Array`) are required for binary or structured memory work — regular arrays forbidden in perf paths.
